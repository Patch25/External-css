        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            People say we shouldn't be together
            We're too young to know about forever
            But I say, "They don't know
            What they're talk-, talk-, talking about"</p>
        <p>
            'Cause this love is only gettin' stronger
            So, I don't wanna wait any longer
            I just wanna tell the world that you're mine, girl, oh
        </p>
        <p>
            They don't know about the things we do
            They don't know about the I-love-yous
            But I bet you if they only knew (they don't know)
            They would just be jealous of us
        </p>
        <p>
            They don't know about the up-all-nights
            They don't know I've waited all my life
            Just to find a love that feels this right (they don't know)
            Baby, they don't know about, they don't know about us
        </p>
